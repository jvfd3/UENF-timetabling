## Setup 

To run this project, you will need to create and activate a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Follow these steps:

## Create and activate the virtual environment

### Open a command prompt and navigate to the project folder. Then run:

#### Linux / Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Windows: 
```bash
python -m venv env
```
```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This will create a folder called `env` inside the project folder, where the virtual environment files will be stored.
You should see `(env)` at the beginning of your prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file in your virtual environment.


You are now ready to run the project!
